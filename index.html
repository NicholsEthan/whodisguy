    music, dancing, graphic design, cheap/free things, and odd things that I don't see often.<br>
    I enjoy time with friends, long walks on the beach, and serving Jehovah. <a
    href="http://jw.org">Click here</a> for more info on that last one.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I love playing instruments with friends. I grew up playing
    piano and was taking lessons since 2nd grade. If you have a witness band or want to start
    one, I'll be there with my keytar bumpin Billy Jean. Or if you just wanna mess around I'm
    down.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I love dancing. Grew up with dance parties every year and
    I'm not about to stop going to them. Grad party, western party, wedding, white party, I'm
    there. No one taught me how to dougie, I'm selfmade. Except for the YouTube video I
    watched on it. Especially love line dances. Biker shuffle, Tucka slide, Flex, Churchclap,
    Wobble (clean), all of it. Get me in there. Do not leave me by the volleyball net when the
    dance starts at 7.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Speaking of volleyball, hit me up. Basketball too. Not
    baseball, kickball tho.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you have old or broken electronics, computers, tablets,
    anything electronic that you don't want anymore, I will absolutely take it. Please don't
    throw it away in a fit of rage if it don't work. I will do my darndest to fix your
    computer/electronics for friends for free. Or if you just don't want it, I will find a
    use, or have it disposed of properly. My arcade machine needs more parts and your old
    computer might help.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you know how to solder, please teach me. I have messed
    up almost every time, and I know it's partially because I'm using a cheap automotive
    soldering iron from Walmart, but also I'm dumb. My goal is to get into microsoldering when
    I'm good enough. As much as big tech companies will force people to buy new Macbooks when
    theirs decides to crap out, I would love to be able to fix what I can, because most people
    shouldn't spend their savings to buy a new computer for easy fixes.</font></td>
